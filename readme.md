## Verify NxN sudoku

This repository contains a script that was created to run tests on files in different folders with the sudoku program in C language.
The script checks the output of the sudoku program for each test case and compares it with the expected output.

<br>
The "login" folder means your folder that contains your code.

### Instructions

1. Make sure the script is in the same folder as the "login" folder. 
2. Change the your_folder variable to your "login".
3. Run this script in the shell: ./script.sh.
4. The script will execute the sudoku program on each .txt file in the folders and will check if the output matches the expected.
5. If errors occur, a file named "error" will be created in the main folder, listing the problematic files.
6. Grant permission: chmod 777 h3ndr1.sh.

### Makefile

It seems that you need to have your Sudoku program written in the C programming language and have a Makefile configured for building the program. Please follow these steps:

1. Ensure that your Sudoku program is written in C and saved with a .c file extension, for example, sudoku.c.
2. Create a Makefile in the same directory as your C source file. The Makefile should contain the necessary rules to compile your C program. In this reposityre has an example.
3. Make sure the script, the "login" folder, and the Makefile are in the same directory.
4. Now, you can follow the instructions provided in the previous response to run the script.sh file. The script will use the Makefile to compile your C program and perform the necessary tests on the .txt files in the specified folders.
